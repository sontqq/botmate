# BOTMATE
Simple keypress based game automatizer

## How to use:
1. Start BotMate with admin rights (not always required)
2. Start your game
3. Insert the game window's title into the second textbox
4. Add your spell (button) list
5. Click START
6. PROFIT

## This is undetecable BUT be sure NOT to rename the window to something suspicious.

Feature requests and suggestions are welcomed!

Source code will not be released until BotMate reaches a stable 1.0 version.

Motivation: I couldn't find a working driverless simple but customizable key presser that I could use for a game for leveling my character while away.
